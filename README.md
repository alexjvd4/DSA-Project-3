# DSA-Project-3
## Our projects goal is to compare how the data structures hashmap and heap compare.
## We have a large database of sales records. The user will use have to load the cvs file we have. Enter the command load then load the file "sales_data.csv".
## One command we use to compare the performance of a hashmap and heap is the top_sale command. The user will enter "top_sale" to run the top_sale command. This command will pull the top performing sale from the CSV file and print it to the user. This command will perform the search both with a heap and a hashmap and print out the performance of each data structure using chrono.
## Another command we use to compare the performances of each data structure is "lookup <id>". Both the heap and hash map data strucutres will be used and their times for each search will display. The heap is sorted by totalProfit while the key values for the hash map are orderIDs.
## We are hypothesizing that the heap will run faster for finding the topSale while the hash map will run faster for the lookup <id>.
