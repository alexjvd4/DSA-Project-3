# DSA-Project-3
## Team Name: Team Skibidi (Group 113)
## Team Members: Alejandro Velez, Rich Nguyen, Hari Patel
## Project Title:
## Problem: We have a sales data set but we do not have a way to visualize or comb through the data to make it digestible.
## Motivation: It is a problem because the data is just collected linearly and cannot be easily separated into collective groups.
## Features: When anyone can easily figure out when an item is sold, where itâ€™s sold, and all of its metadata within reasonable time (minutes of loading).
## Data: Public Data Set: Kaggle Thousand Sales
## Tools: C++, CLion IDE.
## Visuals: (See below Wireframe)
## Strategy: Hash Maps, Heaps
## Distribution of Roles: Rich will work on inserting and searching through hashmaps, Alex will work on inserting and searching through the heaps, and Hari will work on the GUI.
