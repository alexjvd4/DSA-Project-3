# DSA-Project-3
## Our projects goal is to compare how the data structures hashmap and heap compare.
## We have a large database of sales records. The user will use have to load the cvs file we have. Enter the command load then load the file "sales_data.csv". 
##The command we use to compare the performance of a hashmap and heap is the top_sale command. The user will enter "top_sale" to run the top_sale command. This command will pull the top performing sale from the CSV file and print it to the user. Thsi command will perform the search both with a heap and a hashmap and print out the performance of each data structure.
